### Functionalities:

o	Frenzy Lemon – when eating the Frenzy Lemon, the Pacman turns red with rage as he starts an 11 second rampage to kill as much ghosts as he can. While in frenzy mode the ghosts will run away from the Pacman instead of chasing him and the appropriate music will be played to let the user know it’s on!    
o	Teleportation Portals – after a timer of 6 seconds from the beginning of the game or the last disappearance of the portals, they are set to two free random points on the board. Any character (Pacman, ghost or moving prize) that passes through a portal will be immediately teleported to the other portal with the appropriate sound effect and the portals will disappear for another 6 seconds.    
o	Mobs Respawn – every mob that gets eaten by the Pacman (including the ghosts in frenzy mode) respawn after a set of time to insure the game stays interesting.    
o	Sound effects – for various events in the game sound effects have been added to create a more interactive user experience, while still playing the background music.    
o	Ghosts’ eyes move according to moving direction.
